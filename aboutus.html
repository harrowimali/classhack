	<h1> About the Hack! </h1>

	<p> So this hack was made by a rag tag team of 5 High schoolers. Before HackRPI started, It was just me (Ali) and Su Min. Then we met Vicki and she joined out team. Once HackRPI started Sumit and Anish asked us to join our team and with special permission, we were able to have an extra player. After that we just bounced ideas at each other, until Su Min shot this amazing idea, which was essentially this website. She expressed her hardships at Bergen County Academies and the hardships gathering enough notes to get a high grade on her exams. That's where this website came into light. We made a website that gives students the abilty to network with other classmates and compare and collaborate on their notes. My team is very excited to show off our website at HackRPI 2014!</p>
